    "This notebook describes the LAB-3 assignment of the Text Mining course. It is about sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of the assignment are:\n",
    "* Learn how to run a rule-based sentiment analysis module (VADER)\n",
    "* Learn how to run a machine learning sentiment analysis module (Scikit-Learn/ Naive Bayes)\n",
    "* Learn how to run scikit-learn metrics for the quantitative evaluation\n",
    "* Learn how to perform and interpret a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes of the tools (in terms of Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>)\n",
    "* Learn how to evaluate the results qualitatively (by examining the data) \n",
    "* Get insight into differences between the two applied methods\n",
    "* Get insight into the effects of using linguistic preprocessing\n",
    "* Be able to describe differences between the two methods in terms of their results\n",
    "* Get insight into issues when applying these methods across different  domains\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to create your own gold standard set from 50 tweets. You will the VADER and scikit-learn classifiers to these tweets and evaluate the results by using evaluation metrics and inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you go through the notebooks in the following order:\n",
    "* **Read the assignment (see below)**\n",
    "* **Lab3.2-Sentiment-analysis-with-VADER.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Lab3.3-Sentiment-analysis.with-scikit-learn.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Answer the questions of the assignment (see below) using the provided notebooks and submit**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are asked to perform both quantitative evaluations and error analyses:\n",
    "* a quantitative evaluation concerns the scores (Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>) provided by scikit's classification_report. It includes the scores per category, as well as micro and macro averages. Discuss whether the scores are balanced or not between the different categories (positive, negative, neutral) and between precision and recall. Discuss the shortcomings (if any) of the classifier based on these scores\n",
    "* an error analysis regarding the misclassifications of the classifier. It involves going through the texts and trying to understand what has gone wrong. It servers to get insight in what could be done to improve the performance of the classifier. Do you observe patterns in misclassifications?  Discuss why these errors are made and propose ways to solve them."

    "### Question1: Ansers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first sentence has been determined to be of a positive nature. This is visible my the high score for 'pos'  as well as 'compound.' The reason for the high score probably is due to the presence of the word \"love\" in the sentence, which scores very highly on positivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second sentence is the inverse of the first one; and VADER seems to have picked that up very well. This sentence has a very negative rating, which can be observed by the high negative score as well as the low/negative compound score. The reason for this is because the \"don't\" reverses the meaning behind \"love\", turning it from a positive into a negative. VADER is capable of recognizing these kinds of negations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Third sentence is similar to the first one, and Vader has judged it in a similar fashion too. The only difference for the sentence itself is that it includes the presence of a positive sentiment-laden emoticon (that being the smiley face). VADER is capable of picking up those emoticons. And given the positivity behind the smiley-face emoticon, the positive message behind the message gets reinforced even more, leading to the higher rating. What also deserves attention is that the sentence is relatively short, which allows for neutral terms like houses, to play a large role in adding a judgement of neutrality to the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This sentence solely depicts a negative thing. The word \"ruin\" carries with it a negative connotation which probably is why the overal sentence got judged by VADER with an overall negative perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Here again we see a negation getting detected by VADER, but in the opposite direction. Vader has picked up that the houses are the inverse of ruins, which turns the negative into a positive sentiment. But this sentence also includes the word \"very\", which VADER is also capable of recognizing as a degree modifier, causing VADER to reinforce the positivity even more. This causes the compound score to be positive.\n",
    "However, the neutral words like considered and houses add a neutral to the overall judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Now here, VADER's decisions seem to stop making sense. Whilst this sentence appears to us, humans, as purely neutral, VADER however gave it a a mixture between a negative and neutral rating. The reason for this is that that we interpret the word \"lies\" as a form of lying on some thing/object, which is neutral. However, VADER probably interpreted the world \"lies\" as the multiple of the word \"lie\", which carries a strong negative connotation with it. The other words are negative however. This together is what caused the mainly neutral, but also negative rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The final sentence has a similar problem going on. Wheras we would interpret the sentence neutrally because we know the word \"like\" is used in this context to compare two things, VADER interprets the word \"like\" positively, because it is one of the forms of the verb \"to like\", which carries a positive connotation with it. The rest of the sentence is neutral, so VADER judges this sentence as mostly neutral, but also positive, which is wrong to us of course."
